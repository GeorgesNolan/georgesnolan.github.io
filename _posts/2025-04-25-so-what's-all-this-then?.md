I've decided to start writing a personal blog. It's not about depression - I just like the idea of things not necessarily being dressed up to appeal.

I want to write about things I've done and things wot I think. I'm hoping this will help me to better articulate myself. If no one reads this apart from my future self (ideally without cringing too much) then that's fine.
