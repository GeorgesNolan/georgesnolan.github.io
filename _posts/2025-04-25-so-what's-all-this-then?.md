I've decided to start writing a personal blog. Despite the name, it's not about depression. I just liked the idea of choosing something vaguely off-putting and not particularly conducive to self-promotion.

I want to write about things. Things I've done, things wot I think. 

If no one else reads this apart from my future self then that's fine. If my future self isn't bothering to read this then that's pretty typical.
